We investigate the various problems that are due to these emissions along dimensions including their perceived negative impact on the environment and on the health of the city residents. <br><br> We concentrate our attention on evaluating the ways in which data science was or could be used to help reduce building carbon emissions in general and more specifically in the Baltimore City area. We focus on those problems for which we know that datasets are being collected by the city and work towards outlining a few key guidelines for collecting, processing, and getting electrification insights from building datasets.",
